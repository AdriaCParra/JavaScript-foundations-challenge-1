//  What would each of these lines of code do:

    // 1. true && console.log("moo");
    // should print "moo"
    // Because the first value is true, the second value is evaluated and printed

    // 2. false && console.log("moo moo?")
    // should print nothing
    // Because the first value is false, the second value is not evaluated

    // 3. true || console.log("hello friend");
    // should print nothing
    // Because the first value is true, the second value is not evaluated

    // 4. false || console.log("bye friend");
    // should print "bye friend"
    // Because the first value is false, the second value is evaluated and printed

    // Once you see the results, write in a comment why it works that way
